# Unit Template Engine - Employee Summary

The goal was to build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

* The app will run as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee.

In the `Develop` folder, there is a `package.json`, so make sure to `npm install`.

ðŸŽ— Remember, you can run the tests at any time with `npm run test`



### Classes
The project has these classes: `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`,

The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and
methods:

  * name
  * id
  * title
  * getName()
  * getId()
  * getEmail()
  * getRole() // Returns 'Employee'

The other three classes will extend `Employee`. 

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have:

  * officeNumber

  * getRole() // Overridden to return 'Manager'

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Engineer` will also have:

  * github  // GitHub username

  * getGithub()

  * getRole() // Overridden to return 'Engineer'

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Intern` will also have:

  * school 

  * getSchool()

  * getRole() // Overridden to return 'Intern'


### Roster output

The project generates a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:

  * Name

  * Role

  * ID

  * Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)
